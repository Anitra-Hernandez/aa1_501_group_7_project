## Project Intro/Objective

The objective of this project is to predict whether students will drop out or succeed in their studies using the Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and AI and machine learning algorithms with the goal of offering actionable insights for educational institutions to improve student retention and performance. By analyzing demographic, academic, and socio-economic data, we intend to identify at-risk students and understand the factors contributing to academic success.

The motivation for this project stems from the growing need for educational institutions to identify at-risk students early and implement timely interventions. By predicting student dropout and academic success, institutions can tailor their support services to improve student retention and academic performance

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze a dataset related to predicting student dropout and academic success. The dataset is explored through various techniques such as EDA, correlation analysis, and feature selection. Machine learning algorithms are then analyzed and selected for model development, training, and improvement. 

## Dataset Description:

### Data Source:
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Number of Variables:
The dataset contains 36 variables, including demographic, academic, and socio-economic factors.

### Size of the Dataset:
The dataset consists of 4424 records, representing individual students.

### Data Dictionary:



### Research Questions and Hypotheses:

#### Research Question:
What are the most significant factors that contribute to a student's likelihood of dropping out or succeeding in their studies?

Hypothesis 1: Students with lower grades in the first semester are more likely to drop out.

Hypothesis 2: Financial stability, as indicated by up-to-date tuition fees, is a strong predictor of whether a student will continue their studies.

#### Research Question:
How well can machine learning models predict student outcomes based on available demographic, academic, and socio-economic data?

Hypothesis 1: Ensemble models like Random Forests will outperform simpler models like Logistic Regression in predicting student success.

Hypothesis 2: Including a wide range of features will improve model accuracy, but the most significant improvements will come from academic performance indicators.
